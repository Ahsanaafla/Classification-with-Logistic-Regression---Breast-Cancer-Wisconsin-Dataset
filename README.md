# Classification-with-Logistic-Regression---Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-Dataset
This notebook demonstrates a logistic regression model for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Key Steps:
Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)

Train-test split (80-20 ratio)

Logistic regression model training

Model evaluation with metrics:

Confusion matrix

Precision, recall, ROC-AUC

ROC curve visualization

Threshold adjustment (0.6) demonstration

Results:
The model achieves high performance with:
